## Overview

**Leveled vs. Layered Programming**—that is the question.

- **Leveled programming**: Focuses on hierarchical abstractions, where each "level" has a specific and singular purpose.
- **Layered programming**: Embraces flexibility and organic design, with components interacting freely. Layers represent logical groupings rather than rigid hierarchies.

### What’s Qoraal About?

Qoraal embodies **layered architecture**, where modules coexist side by side, allowing for a seamless and flexible development experience.

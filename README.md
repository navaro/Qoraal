Leveled vs. layered programming, that is the question.

Leveled programming is all about hierarchical abstractions where each "level" has a specific, singular focus. Layered programming, on the other hand, is flexible and organic, with components interacting more freely. Layers are more about logical groupings than rigid hierarchies.

Let’s get into it.

Qoraal is all about layered architecture, where modules coexist side by side. Keep your scanners peeled, there’s more to come.
